    "overview": "The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (\u201cPDP Bill\u201d)  was introduced in Parliament on 11 December 2019. If passed, the law will  require organisations to revamp their data-related processes and embed privacy within their systems and operations.  \n  \nAccountability is a key feature of the PDP Bill and organisations should be prepared to demonstrate compliance with its requirements. The PDP Bill proposes significant penalties for non-compliance that could go up to 4% of total worldwide turnover of an entity. \n  \nThe PDP Bill establishes a new regulator \u2013 the Data Protection Authority of India (\u201cDPA\u201d) \u2013 that is entrusted with enforcing this new law and ensuring compliance.  \n  \nThis checklist is intended to be a starting point for organisations to understand their obligations under the law. The checklist lists out compliance requirements and action items for organisations under five heads: (i)  understanding scope and preparing for the law; (ii) accountability; (iii) fair and lawful processing; (iv) data principals\u2019 rights; and (v) transferring data outside India. \n\nThe checklist indicates whether a set of actions is relevant for data fiduciaries (data controllers) (\u201cDFs\u201d) or data processors (\u201cDPs\u201d) or both. It also identifies the relevant teams that need to be involved in each set of actions: Legal/ Compliance, Public Relations, Technical and IT, HR and Customer Relations.\n",
