PDP 2019 Checklist
==================


The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (“PDP Bill”)  was introduced in Parliament on 11 December 2019. If passed, the law will  require organisations to revamp their data-related processes and embed privacy within their systems and operations.  
  
Accountability is a key feature of the PDP Bill and organisations should be prepared to demonstrate compliance with its requirements. The PDP Bill proposes significant penalties for non-compliance that could go up to 4% of total worldwide turnover of an entity. 
  
The PDP Bill establishes a new regulator – the Data Protection Authority of India (“DPA”) – that is entrusted with enforcing this new law and ensuring compliance.  
  
This checklist is intended to be a starting point for organisations to understand their obligations under the law. The checklist lists out compliance requirements and action items for organisations under five heads: (i)  understanding scope and preparing for the law; (ii) accountability; (iii) fair and lawful processing; (iv) data principals’ rights; and (v) transferring data outside India. 

The checklist indicates whether a set of actions is relevant for data fiduciaries (data controllers) (“DFs”) or data processors (“DPs”) or both. It also identifies the relevant teams that need to be involved in each set of actions: Legal/ Compliance, Public Relations, Technical and IT, HR and Customer Relations.

# UNDERSTANDING SCOPE AND PREPARING FOR THE LAW

## Scope


The PDP Bill applies to the processing of ‘personal data’. Processing means collection, use, storage, sharing or any other activity related to data.

The PDP Bill regulates data-processing activities of ‘data fiduciaries’ and ‘data processors’.

‘Significant data fiduciaries’ are required to comply with heightened obligations, such as conducting data protection impact assessments, appointing a data protection officer, record-keeping, and having their processes audited yearly. Social media intermediaries are classified as ‘significant data fiduciaries’ under the PDP Bill.

## Territorial Scope


The PDP Bill applies to data processing in India and to processing by Indian entities. 

The PDP Bill applies to processing outside India if it is in connection with any business carried out in India, or the systematic offering of goods or services in India; or in connection with any activity that involves profiling of data principals in India.

The central government can exempt certain data processors from the law, where pursuant to contracts with offshore entities, data processors process data of individuals who are outside India.

## Data Inventory


Significant data fiduciaries are required to keep records of important operations in the data life cycle. 

While not specifically required, several provisions such as privacy by design, data protection impact assessment, etc. will start with the preparation of a data inventory and mapping data flows. An inventory is the first step towards compliance with the PDP Bill.

# ACCOUNTABILITY

## Privacy by design policy


Data fiduciaries should prepare a privacy by design policy. They may get this certified by the DPA. Once certified, they will be eligible to participate in a sandbox proposed under the PDP Bill. Through this privacy by design policy, they should embed privacy features in their systems and adopt suitable organisational and technical systems.

## Data Protection Impact Assessment


Before undertaking certain processing activities, significant data fiduciaries are required to conduct a data protection impact assessment (“DPIA”). The activities for which a DPIA is required: processing involving new technologies or large scale profiling or use of sensitive personal data, or processing which carries a significant risk of harm to data principals.
(The DPA will decide whether all organisations have to comply with this requirement or only significant data fiduciaries.)
